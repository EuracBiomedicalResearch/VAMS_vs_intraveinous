# Introduction

In this section we perform the pre-processing of negative polarity untargeted
metabolomics data of the *MitYOU* project.  This comprises an initial quality
assessment, chromatographic peak detection, alignment (retention time
correction) and correspondence (chromatographic peak grouping across
samples). The analysis is performed analogously to the analysis described in
*vams_preprocessing.Rmd*. General data descriptions are thus not repeated here.

# Negative polarity

## Raw data import and initial quality assessment

Below we load all required libraries for the analysis as well as the *phenodata*
file defining the experiment's layout. Also, we set up the parallel processing,
define colors to be used for the various experimental groups throughout the
experiment and finally read the raw data.

```{r neg-libraries-data, message = FALSE}
library(xcms)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(pander)
library(doParallel)
library(magrittr)
library(pheatmap)
registerDoParallel(ncores)
register(DoparParam(), default = TRUE)

pd <- read.table("data/phenodata.txt", sep = "\t", as.is = TRUE, header = TRUE)
pd_neg <- pd[pd$polarity == "NEG", ]

## Define colors for the groups.
col_source <- brewer.pal(5, name = "Set1")
names(col_source) <- c("RBC",           # red
                       "plasma",        # blue
                       "all",           # green
                       "capillary",     # purple
                       "venous")        # orange
## Read the data
data_neg <- readMSData(paste0(MZML_PATH, pd_neg$mzML_file),
                       pdata = as(AnnotatedDataFrame(pd_neg),
                                  "NAnnotatedDataFrame"), mode = "onDisk")
data_neg <- filterRt(data_neg, rt = c(0, rt_cut))
```

All samples of the experiment are listed below.

```{r neg-phenodata, message = FALSE, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
validatePdata <- function(x) {
    src <- c(`1` = "plasma", `2` = "venous", `3` = "capillary", RBC = "RBC")
    fn <- strsplit(x$mzML_file, split = "_")
    for (i in 1:nrow(x)) {
        splt <- fn[[i]]
        if (substr(splt[1], 2, nchar(splt[1])) != x$batch[i])
            message("Row ", i, ": batch wrong")
        if (length(splt) == 5) {
            if (as.numeric(splt[2]) != x$sample[i])
                message("Row ", i, ": sample wrong")
            if (src[splt[3]] != x$source[i])
                message("Row ", i, ": source wrong")
            if ((splt[4] == "a" & x$replicate[i] != 1) ||
                (splt[4] == "b" & x$replicate[i] != 2))
                message("Row ", i, ": replicate wrong")
        } else {
            if (x$sample[i] != "POOL")
                message("Row ", i, ": sample wrong")
        }
    }
}
## validatePdata(pData(data_neg))

tab <- pData(data_neg)[, -4]
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste0("Data files and samples for negative polarity"))

```

The data set consists thus of samples from in total 22 individuals, with
measurements performed on plasma, venous and capillary blood samples as well as
on red blood cells for each. Measurements were performed in two runs, with each
sample measured in duplicates within each run. A pool of all samples (all
sources and samples) was used as quality control and repeatedly measured (every
9 injections) during a measurement run. The injection order layout of one
measurement run is visualized below.

```{r neg-run-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.cap = "Layout of a measurement run."}
tmp <- pData(data_neg)[data_neg$batch == 6022018, ]
par(mar = c(2, 0, 2, 0))
plot(3, 3, pch = NA, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylim = c(0, 2),
     xlim = c(0.5, nrow(tmp) + 0.5), bty = "n")
rect(xleft = tmp$inj_idx - 0.5, xright = tmp$inj_idx + 0.5, ybottom = 0,
     ytop = 1, col = col_source[tmp$source], border = "grey")
axis(side = 1, line = 0, las = 2)
text(x = tmp$inj_idx, y = rep(0.5, nrow(tmp)), labels = tmp$sample,
     srt = 90, cex = 0.7)
legend("top", col = col_source, legend = names(col_source), horiz = TRUE,
       pch = 15)
```

Sample source type and individuals are randomly distributed along the injection
order.

Next we perform an initial quality assessment by comparing the distribution of
TIC and BPC values from the spectra between all samples.

```{r neg-calc-tic, message = FALSE}
chrs_tic <- chromatogram(data_neg, aggregationFun = "sum")
chrs_bpc <- chromatogram(data_neg, aggregationFun = "max")
```

The base peak chromatogram for the full experiment is shown below.

```{r neg-bpc-plot, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Base peak chromatograms for all samples of the experiment (negative polarity)."}
plot(chrs_bpc, col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], "60"))
abline(v = rt_cut)
legend("topright", col = col_source, legend = names(col_source), lwd = 2)

```

The base peak chromatograms are quite different between the different sample
sources. Similar to the positive polarity mode, the largest differences between
sample sources can be observed in the retention time range from 170 to 210
seconds. Especially capillary samples show much lower signal in that area. We
next cluster samples based on pair-wise correlations of their (log2) base peak
intensities.

```{r neg-bin-chr, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12, fig.cap = "Samples clustered by base peak chromatogram. Clustering bases on complete linkage hierarchical clustering of pairwise correlations of log2 base peak signals."}
## First we have to bin the chromatograms to force them having the same
## retention times.
chrs_bin <- bin(chrs_bpc)

## Calculating the correlation on the log2 transformed bp signals
cormat <- cor(log2(do.call(cbind, lapply(chrs_bin, intensity))))
colnames(cormat) <- rownames(cormat) <- sampleNames(data_neg)
ann <- pData(data_neg)[, c("batch", "source")]
ann$batch <- factor(ann$batch, levels = c("6022018", "7022018"))
res <- pheatmap(cormat, annotation_col = ann, cutree_cols = 3,
                annotation_color = list(source = col_source))

```

The base peak chromatograms cluster mainly by the sample source, separating all
capillary samples and most red blood cell samples from other sources
(i.e. plasma, all, and venous samples). No clear separation by batch is present.

In contrast to the positive polarity data, no clear set of outlier samples can
be identified.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Perform the PCA
pc <- prcomp(t(log2(do.call(cbind, lapply(chrs_bin, intensity)))),
             scale = FALSE, center = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
BioCHRIStes::plot_pca(pc, col = col_clust[clust_one], pc_x = 1, pc_y = 2)
BioCHRIStes::plot_pca(pc, col = col_clust[clust_one], pc_x = 3, pc_y = 4)
BioCHRIStes::plot_pca(pc, col = col_clust[clust_one], pc_x = 2, pc_y = 3)
text(pc$x[, 2], pc$x[, 3], label = sampleNames(chrs_bin),
     col = col_clust[clust_one])


## cols <- rep("#00000040", length(chrs_bin$source))
## keep_idx <- c(166, 169, 133, 192, 111, 125, 113, 157)
## rem_idx <- c(74, 158, 172, 174, 194, 177, 149, 186, 188, 167, 178)
## cols[keep_idx] <- "#0000ff80"
## cols[rem_idx] <- "#ff000080"

## BioCHRIStes::plot_pca(pc, col = cols, pc_x = 2, pc_y = 3)

## plot(chrs_bpc, col = cols)

```

Next we evaluate the distribution of base peak and total ion values per sample
to identify potentially problematic samples/injections. In addition we calculate
per-sample RLA (relative log abundance) [@DeLivera:2012bw] values representing
average log2 signal (either base peak or total ion) of each sample relative to
the median log2 signal of all samples within the same group. The per sample RLA
values help to spot samples with an overall different average signal compared to
all other samples within the same sample group, which is in our case the sample
source.

```{r neg-bpc-boxplot, message = FALSE, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Distribution of the spectras' base peak signal per sample (top) and average RLA of base peak signals per sample (bottom). Potential outlier samples identified based on their base peak intensities are indicated with squares."}
bpcs <- lapply(chrs_bpc, intensity)
xl <- c(1, length(bpcs))
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 0, 0.1))
boxplot(lapply(bpcs, log2), col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], 60),
        pch = NA, xaxt = "n", ylab = expression(log[2]~base~peak~intensity),
        xlim = xl)
grid(nx = NULL)
par(mar = c(3, 4.3, 0.5, 0.1))
bpcs_rla <- rla(vapply(bpcs, mean, numeric(1)), group = chrs_bpc$source)
pch <- rep(16, length(bpcs_rla))
plot(bpcs_rla, xlab = "", ylab = "average RLA", xlim = xl,
     col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], 80), pch = pch)
grid(nx = NULL)

```

The (base peak) signal from capillary blood samples is generally lower than that
of all other sample types. According to the RLA, only 3 samples, all
representing red blood cell-samples show a generally lower intensity than all
other samples from the same sample type. Below we list the samples with a more
than two-fold lower signal compared to other samples of the same source/matrix.

```{r neg-bpc-outlier, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "asis"}
outl <- abs(bpcs_rla) > 1
outl_smps <- paste0(chrs_bpc$sample[outl], chrs_bpc$source[outl])
all_outl <- paste0(chrs_bpc$sample, chrs_bpc$source) %in% outl_smps
tab <- cbind(pData(chrs_bpc)[all_outl, ], bpc_rla = bpcs_rla[all_outl])

pandoc.table(tab[order(abs(tab$bpc_rla), decreasing = TRUE), ],
             style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste0("Samples for which one replicated measurement ",
                              "had a more than two-fold difference in average",
                              " base peak intensity."))
```

For all of the above samples one of the two replicates yielded a more than
two-fold difference in average base peak intensity, while the other did
not. Also, two of the above outlier samples (second replicates for individuals
22 and 11) were also identified as outliers in the positive polarity mode
arguing for a problem with the respective Mitra tip. We will remove the 3
affected outlier samples from the further analysis.

### Summary

The base peak and total ion chromatogram of capillary blood samples are
different to those from all other matrices/sample types. Also, their average
base peak signal is considerably lower, but consistent between samples of the
same type. 3 Potentially problematic samples have been identified, two of which
were also identified as outliers in the positive polarity data. These will be
excluded from the further analysis.


## Chromatographic peak detection

Key parameters for the *centWave* [@Tautenhahn:2008fx] chromatographic peak
detection algorithm are `ppm` and `peakwidth`, the first defining the allowed
scattering in m/z dimension of valid chromatographic peaks and the second
defining the lower and upper bound of chromatographic peak width (in
seconds). We empirically determine the *best* values for these parameters by
evaluating the raw MS data for selected known compounds in QC samples. We thus
load below the list of known compounds with the theoretical m/z value of the
most likely ion adduct and their expected retention time window.

```{r known-cmps}
known_cmps <- read.table("data/txt/_input_Known_Compounds.txt", sep = "\t",
                         as.is = TRUE, header = TRUE)
rownames(known_cmps) <- known_cmps$id
neg_cmps <- known_cmps[!is.na(known_cmps$mz_ion_neg), ]
neg_cmps$mz <- neg_cmps$mz_ion_neg

```

This list of compounds is further reduced by visually inspecting the MS data and
by re-defining the retention time window in the present data.

```{r known-cmps-neg, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## This code needs to be run only once. We have to go through the images anyway
## to manually select/refine regions.
qc_neg <- filterFile(data_neg, file = which(data_neg$sample == "POOL"))

dir.create(paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "/tmp"), showWarnings = FALSE)

for (i in 1:nrow(neg_cmps)) {
    fn <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "/tmp/", neg_cmps$id[i], ".png")
    mz_exp <- neg_cmps$mz[i]
    mz_ppm <- mz_exp * 20 / 1e6         # for a ppm = 40
    mzr <- mz_exp + c(-mz_ppm, mz_ppm)
    rtr <- neg_cmps$rt_expected[i] + c(-20, 20)
    tmp_chr <- chromatogram(qc_neg, rt = rtr + c(-5, 5), mz = mzr)
    png(fn, width = 8, height = 6, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot(tmp_chr, main = paste0(neg_cmps[i, "name"], ": ",
                                paste(format(mzr, digits = 6), collapse = "-")))
    abline(v = neg_cmps$rt_expected[i], lty = 3)
    dev.off()
    ## png(fn, width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    ## plot(filterMz(filterRt(qc_neg, rtr), mzr), type = "XIC")
    ## dev.off()
}
## Now happily jump into the folder to look at the data and:
## a) select known compounds to keep
## b) define their rt width

```

For known compounds, the m/z values within a (slightly extended) retention time
window containing the compound's peak are extracted from QC samples and a ppm
representing the largest difference between consecutive m/z values for the ion
are calculated (for each compound and each file). The mean and 75% quantile ppm
across files is shown below in the table listing the compounds used in this
analysis.

```{r known-cmps-neg-define, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}

The average difference of m/z values between consecutive scans within
chromatographic peaks of the known compounds is surprisingly large. We use thus
a `ppm = 50` to ensure that the *regions of interest* (ROIs) in which centWave
performs the peak detection include the full, or the largest part, of the
chromatographic peak of the ions. The average width of chromatographic peaks is
about 7 seconds, thus we use a `peakwidth = c(2, 14)`.

positive-mode data, with the most peaks being found in venous samples and the
fewest in RBC samples. Also, RBC samples show the highest variability in the
numbers of identified peaks with three samples yielding a very low number of
peaks (between 4000 and 6000). These are the second replicate for sample 11, 16
and 22, the same samples that have already been identified further above.

The table below shows the per-sample median values
summarized per source type.

```{r neg-peaks-summary-table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "asis"}
## - peak count
## - m/z width
## - rt width
## Aggregate these per sample group.
smpl_summary <- cbind(peak_count = vapply(pk_list, nrow, numeric(1)),
                      do.call(rbind, lapply(pk_list, function(z) {
                          c(median_mz_width = median(z[, "mz_width_ppm"]),
                            median_rt_width = median(z[, "rt_width"]))
                      })))
tab <- aggregate(smpl_summary, by = list(source = data_neg$source), quantile)
rownames(tab) <- tab[, 1]
tab <- tab[, -1]
pandoc.table(t(tab), style = "rmarkdown", 
             cap = paste("Summary of peak detection results. Shown are the",
                         "per-source quantiles of the numbers of identified",
                         "peaks, of the median m/z and rt widths per sample."))
```

The per-sample median m/z width of the identified peaks is on average quite
low and consistent across sample types, same as the retention time width. The
only apparent differences are for the numbers of detected peaks. Here plasma
samples show the lowest and venous samples the highest numbers.

### Summary

The settings for the centWave-based chromatographic peak detection might still
have to be slightly modified, specifically the `ppm` and the `mzdiff`
parameters.

On average about 9000 chromatographic peaks were identified per sample, with the
median m/z width of these peaks being quite small.


## Alignment

After detection, chromatographic peaks have to be aligned to adjust for any
retention time differences due to shifts or biases of the LC. We will use the
*peak groups* method, that aligns samples based on *hook* peaks that are present
in most samples. We thus first group chromatographic peaks requiring them to be
present in 80% of the samples within each group and use these as the *hook*
peaks. Most of the settings for the peak grouping can then be reused for the
correspondence analysis in the next section. Note that before alignment we
remove potentially problematic samples. We are setting `binSize = 0.02` to
avoid chromatographic peaks with highly similar m/z values (within the same
file) to be grouped into the same feature. This has been defined by evaluating
the distance in m/z between chromatographic peaks in the same file in a region
with a high peak density (see plot below).

```{r neg-mz-distance-peaks-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Position of detected chromatographic peaks within a sample. Shown are chromatographic peaks in a region with high peak density. The horizontal blue line represents the bin width if binSize = 0.02 was used."}
plotChromPeaks(filterMz(data_neg, mz = c(756, 758)), 1)
abline(h = c(757, 757.02), col = "#0000ff80")

```

To define the `bw` parameter, the other important parameter to the peak
density-based peak grouping, we evaluate the impact of different values on an
extracted ion chromatogram with several consecutive peaks. Such MS data slices
can be identified by visualizing the position of identified peaks on the 2
dimensional MS data map with the `plotChromPeaks` function. The `bw` parameter
should be defined in a way that allows separation of these peaks.

```{r neg-bw-definition-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result on the m/z slice containing Fructose and Mannose. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks in that slice along the retention time axis (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 1.3, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}

plot_grouping <- function(x, mz, rt, param, col = "#000000",
                          peak_type = "point", lwd = 1, ...) {
    if (missing(rt))
        rt <- range(rtime(x))
    chr_tmp <- chromatogram(x, mz = mz, rt = rt)
    col_tmp <- col[chromPeaks(chr_tmp)[, "sample"]]
    plotChromPeakDensity(chr_tmp, param = pdp_tmp, peakPch = 16,
                         col = paste0(col, 60),
                         peakCol = paste0(col_tmp, 40),
                         peakBg = paste0(col_tmp, 10))
}

mzr <- c(202.18, 202.2)
rtr <- c(30, 150)
mzr <- neg_cmps[c("kc_81"), "mz"] + c(-0.002, 0.002)
rtr <- c(155, 175)
pdp_tmp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_neg$source, bw = 1.1)

plot_grouping(data_neg, mz = mzr, rt = rtr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = col_source[data_neg$source])
```

With a smoothing bandwidth `bw = 1.1` we are able to separate the Fructose and
Mannose peak. Question is whether we will want to do that since not in all
samples two distinct peaks were identified.

In addition we evaluate the bandwidth setting on the peaks for Sucrose and
alpha-Lactose.

```{r neg-bw-definition-2-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result for Sucrose and alpha-Lactose. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks for Sucrose and alpha-Lactose (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 1.3, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
mzr <- neg_cmps["kc_125", "mz"] + c(-0.002, 0.0021)
rtr <- c(175, 198)
plot_grouping(data_neg, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = col_source[data_neg$source])
```

Also, with the bandwidth setting we can discriminate between two peaks measured
at the m/z and rt for Glucoronic Acid.

```{r neg-bw-definition-3-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result for Glucoronic acid. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks found in the m/z-rt slice (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 1.3, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
mzr <- neg_cmps["kc_94", "mz"] + c(-0.002, 0.0021)
rtr <- c(160, 180)
plot_grouping(data_neg, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = col_source[data_neg$source])
```

For the alignment we require a *hook* peak to be present in at least 90% of
samples. We also increase the smoothing parameter for the loess function 
(`span = 0.3`). With the default value of `span = 0.2`
alignment resulted in spectra within some files to be not ordered by retention
time anymore. Setting the parameter `extraPeaks = 50` ensured *hook* peaks not
being discarded because of the grouping of additional peaks within the same
sample to the same feature. Setting this parameter to a large value resulted in
*hook* peaks that span almost the full retention time range.

```{r neg-alignment-group, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Remove potentially problematic samples. These were manually defined.
bad_idx <- c(74, 152, 178)

data_neg <- filterFile(data_neg, file = seq_along(data_neg$sample)[-bad_idx])

## Define the peak grouping parameters to define the hook peaks
## These should be peaks present in most samples
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_neg$source,
                        minFraction = 0.8,
                        minSamples = 5,
                        binSize = 0.02,
                        bw = 1.1)
data_neg <- groupChromPeaks(data_neg, param = pdp)

## Next we perform the alignemnt.
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 0.9, extraPeaks = 50, span = 0.3)
data_neg <- adjustRtime(data_neg, param = pgp)

```

The results from the alignment are shown below. The base peak chromatograms are
slightly more overlapping after alignment. Also, adjustment of retention time is
smaller 5 seconds for most of the signal, which is what we would expect from
such a small experiment consisting of only two measurement runs.

```{r neg-alignment-rtime-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10, fig.cap = "Alignment result. Shown are the raw base peak chromatogram, the base peak chromatogram after alignment and the difference between the adjusted and raw retention time. Grey dots indicate hook peaks on which the alignment based."}

chr_raw <- chromatogram(data_neg, aggregationFun = "max", adjustedRtime = FALSE)
chr_adj <- chromatogram(data_neg, aggregationFun = "max")
par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 2, 0.1))
plot(chr_raw, col = paste0(col_source[chr_raw$source], 40), peakType = "none",
     main = "BPC, raw")
plot(chr_adj, col = paste0(col_source[chr_raw$source], 40), peakType = "none",
     main = "BPC, adjusted")
plotAdjustedRtime(data_neg, col = paste0(col_source[data_neg$source], 80))

```

At last we generate extracted ion chromatogram plots of the raw and adjusted
data for the list of known compounds. These are visually inspected to evaluate
the impact of the alignment. The plots for some representative compounds are
shown below.

```{r neg-alignment-kc-plots, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

data_raw <- dropAdjustedRtime(data_neg)
dir.create(paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "alignment/"))
## Visualizing alignment results for known compounds.
for (i in 1:nrow(neg_cmps)) {
    rtr <- as.numeric(neg_cmps[i, c("rt_min", "rt_max")])
    mzr <- c(neg_cmps$mz[i] - 0.002, neg_cmps$mz[i] + 0.002)
    ## A plot.
    pks <- chromPeaks(data_neg, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, type = "apex_within")
    if (nrow(pks)) {
        rtr <- range(pks[, c("rtmin", "rtmax")], rtr)
        rtr[1] <- rtr[1] - 2
        rtr[2] <- rtr[2] + 2
        mz_pks <- range(pks[, c("mzmin", "mzmax")])
    } else mz_pks <- mzr
    fn <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "alignment/", neg_cmps$id[i],
                 "_chrom_plot_adjusted.png")
    chr_raw <- chromatogram(data_raw, rt = rtr, mz = mz_pks)
    chr_adj <- chromatogram(data_neg, rt = rtr, mz = mz_pks,
                            adjustedRtime = TRUE)
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 0.5, 0))
    tmp_col <- col_source[data_neg$source][chromPeaks(chr_raw)[, "sample"]]
    plot(chr_raw, col = paste0(col_source[data_neg$source], 60), xlim = rtr,
         peakBg = paste0(tmp_col, 20))
    grid(ny = NA)
    tmp_col <- col_source[data_neg$source][chromPeaks(chr_adj)[, "sample"]]
    plot(chr_adj, col = paste0(col_source[data_neg$source], 60), xaxt = "n",
         xlim = rtr, peakBg = paste0(tmp_col, 20))
    grid(ny = NA)
    dev.off()    
}


```

For almost all compounds the retention time correction resulted in better
aligned chromatograms.


### Summary

We used the peak groups method for alignment that uses *hook* peaks expected to
be present in all samples for the alignment.

## Correspondence

Correspondence aims to group chromatographic peaks of the same ion across
samples. We re-use settings for the grouping performed already in the previous
section (i.e. the bandwidth parameter) but reduce the `binSize` parameter to
ensure that peaks from different ions possibly close in m/z dimension are not
grouped. Also, we reduce the `minFraction` parameter to allow definition of
features that are present in fewer individuals.

```{r neg-correspondence}
## Define settings for the correspondence and perform the analysis
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_neg$source,
                        minFraction = 1/3,
                        minSamples = 3,
                        binSize = 0.01,
                        bw = 1.1)
data_neg <- groupChromPeaks(data_neg, param = pdp)

```

```{r neg-correspondence-kc-plots, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
dir.create(paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "correspondence/"))
for (i in 1:nrow(neg_cmps)) {
    rtr <- as.numeric(neg_cmps[i, c("rt_min", "rt_max")])
    mzr <- c(neg_cmps$mz[i] - 0.002, neg_cmps$mz[i] + 0.002)
    pks <- chromPeaks(data_neg, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, type = "apex_within")
    if (nrow(pks))
        rtr_pks <- c(min(rtr[1], pks[, "rtmin"]), max(rtr[2], pks[, "rtmax"]))
    else rtr_pks <- rtr
    chrs <- chromatogram(data_neg, mz = mzr, rt = rtr_pks)
    nfts <- nrow(featureDefinitions(chrs))
    clrs <- brewer.pal(9, "Set1")[seq_len(nfts)]
    fts <- featureDefinitions(chrs)
    pk_col <- rep("#000000", nrow(chromPeaks(chrs)))
    for (j in seq_len(nfts)) {
        pk_col[featureDefinitions(chrs)$peakidx[[j]]] <- clrs[j]
    }
    fn <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "correspondence/", neg_cmps$id[i],
                 "_chrom_plot_correspondence.png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot(chrs, peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 20))
    abline(v = rtr, col = "#00000080", lty = 3)
    for (j in seq_len(nrow(fts)))
        abline(v = c(fts$rtmin[j], fts$rtmax[j]), col = paste0(clrs[j], 80),
               lty = 3)
    dev.off()
}
```

Correspondence analysis performed well, being able to separate Mannose and
Fructose peaks into two different features for most samples (see below). Note
however that in some samples peak detection failed to separate the signal in two
distinct peaks. These can be seen as faint purple shapes in the plot below.

![](images/vams_preprocessing_neg/correspondence/kc_82_chrom_plot_correspondence.png)

For Phenylalanine the feature definitions might however be problematic for the
capillary samples in which a single peak seems to be present (peaks with a
retention time of their apex between 147 and 150). These are, depending on their
retention time assigned to one of the features for the two peaks being present
in most other samples (the peaks in capillary samples.

![](images/vams_preprocessing_neg/correspondence/kc_61_chrom_plot_correspondence.png)

    trues <- list(total = feat_summ[, "count"] > 0,

            names(cnt) <- c(nms, paste0("in > ", perc, "%"))
        }
        cnt
    }))
}

pandoc.table(featureSummaryTable(feat_summ), style = "rmarkdown", 
             caption = paste("Summary of the correspondence analysis. Shown",
                             "are counts of features, counts of features with",
                             "at least one samples in which multiple peaks",

                             "of features with different amount of samples",
                             "having multiple peaks."))

```

Three quarters of the features are *single peak features*, i.e. have only a
single chromatographic peak assigned per sample. The number of features present
in more than 90% of samples is low, but not unexpected, since we do have a
relatively heterogeneous group of individuals, and are also comparing different
sample sources.

Next we evaluate the integrated signal for features in QC samples. This is
expected to be similar between QC samples. Differences can, besides batch
effects or injection order dependent effects, also be caused by differences in
the identified chromatographic peak boundaries. We thus extract below feature
intensities and subset these to QC samples.

```{r feature-vals-QC, message = FALSE}
## We extract the integrated original signal and use the signal from the peak
## with the larger signal for multi-peak features.
fmat <- featureValues(data_neg, value = "into", method = "maxint")

## Subset to QC samples and remove features not present in 90% of the samples
fmat_qc <- fmat[, data_neg$source == "all"]
nsamp <- ncol(fmat_qc)
fmat_qc <- fmat_qc[apply(fmat_qc, MARGIN = 1,
                         function(z) (sum(!is.na(z)) / nsamp) >= 0.9), ]
```

Next we determine per-row differences that will be used to asses overall
similarity between replicates. In log2 scale, we calculate the maximal
difference (`M_range`) and, to avoid results being influenced by outliers,
differences between abundances after removing the lower and upper 1% of signals
(`diff_98`. These `M` values represent thus log fold change differences in
abundances.

```{r feature-vals-diff, message = FALSE}
## Calculat maximal differences...
diff_fun <- function(z) {
    c(M_range = diff(range(z, na.rm = TRUE)),
      M_98 = unname(diff(quantile(z, probs = c(0.01, 0.99), na.rm = TRUE))),
      M_90 = unname(diff(quantile(z, probs = c(0.05, 0.95), na.rm = TRUE))))
}
QC_diffs <- t(apply(log2(fmat_qc), MARGIN = 1, FUN = diff_fun))

```

The table below lists the quantiles of these differences.

```{r feature-vals-diff-table, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
tab <- apply(QC_diffs, MARGIN = 2, quantile)
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste("Overview of the abundance differences between",
                             "QC samples. Shown are quantiles for the M_range",
                             "(log2 difference between the most extreme values",
                             "for a feature), M_98 (log2 difference after",
                             "removing the top 1% and lowest 1% of values for",
                             "a feature) and M_90 (log2 difference after",
                             "removing the top and lowest 5% of values per",
                             "feature). The analysis bases on", nrow(QC_diffs),
                             "features."))
```

The plot below shows the distribution of log2 ratios in abundances and their
dependency on average abundance.

```{r feature-vals-diff-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Distribution of log2 ratios in abundances between QC samples and their dependency on their average abundance.", fig.widht = 10, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 1))
boxplot(QC_diffs, ylab = expression(log[2]~abundance~ratio))
grid(nx = NA, ny = NULL)
plot(rowMeans(log2(fmat_qc), na.rm = TRUE), QC_diffs[, 1],
     xlab = expression(log[2]~average~abundance),
     ylab = expression(log[2]~abundance~ratio), pch = 16, col = "#00000060")
grid()
```

Next we inspect the data for features from 3 different classes, i.e. features
with single peaks, features having occasionally additional peaks and peaks with
additional peaks in more than 50% of samples. Also, we aim to identify features
that have single peaks in samples from one source, but multiple in others.


### Single peak features

These are supposedly higher quality features. We below identify these peaks and
subsequently create extracted ion chromatograms for 30 randomly chosen ones, 10
with low (signal below 10000), 10 with intermediate (10000 to 20000) and 10 with
high signal intensities (above 2000). For the selection we focus in addition on
features that are present in at least one third of samples.

```{r neg-single-peak-features, message = FALSE}
## Selecting features with a single peak being present
## in more than 33% of samples.
feats <- rownames(feat_summ)[feat_summ[, "multi_count"] == 0 &
                             feat_summ[, "perc"] > 100/3]
rms <- rowMeans(fmat[feats, ], na.rm = TRUE)
feats_low <- sample(feats[rms < 10000], 10)
feats_int <- sample(feats[rms > 10000 & rms < 20000], 10)
feats_high <- sample(feats[rms > 20000], 10)

```

The chromatograms for most of these peaks look OK, especially for the high
intensity group. Potentially problematic could be the occasional very broad
chromatographic peaks in some samples for low and intermediate abundance
features.

### Features having occasionally additional peaks

These are features that have an additional peak in less than 10% of
samples. Again we require the features to have a peak in more then 30% of
samples and select 10 random features for low, intermediate and high
intensities.

```{r neg-occasional-multi-features, message = FALSE}
## Selecting features with occacional multiple peaks
## being present. A peak has to be present also in more than 33% of samples.
feats <- rownames(feat_summ)[feat_summ[, "multi_count"] > 0 &
                             feat_summ[, "multi_perc"] < 10 &
                             feat_summ[, "perc"] > 100/3]
rms <- rowMeans(fmat[feats, ], na.rm = TRUE)
feats_low <- sample(feats[rms < 10000], 10)
feats_int <- sample(feats[rms > 10000 & rms < 20000], 10)
feats_high <- sample(feats[rms > 20000], 10)

```

```{r neg-occasional-multi-features-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "occasional_multi_peak_fts/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)

for (feat in feats_low) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, "low-", feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot_feature(data_neg, feat)
    dev.off()
}
for (feat in feats_int) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, "int-", feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot_feature(data_neg, feat)
    dev.off()
}
for (feat in feats_high) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, "high-", feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot_feature(data_neg, feat)
    dev.off()
}

```

Some of the features represent signal from isomers with multiple peaks, with
some of the peaks being assigned to one feature. For others the peak shape shows
plateu which represents most likely to the identified peak being split into two.
Examples for isomers with separate features, for which some peaks overlap
however the other feature are shown below.

```{r manual-isomers, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10, fig.cap = "Examples of isomers for which chromatographic peaks overlap both features."}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 1))
chrs <- chromatogram(data_neg, mz = c(356.836, 356.864), rt = c(148, 163))
pk_col <- rep("#000000", nrow(chromPeaks(chrs)))
for (i in 1:nrow(featureDefinitions(chrs))) {
    pk_col[featureDefinitions(chrs)$peakidx[[i]]] <- brewer.pal(9, "Set1")[i]
}
plot(chrs, peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 80), peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10))

chrs <- chromatogram(data_neg, mz = c(179.056, 179.058), rt = c(160, 170))
pk_col <- rep("#000000", nrow(chromPeaks(chrs)))
for (i in 1:nrow(featureDefinitions(chrs))) {
    pk_col[featureDefinitions(chrs)$peakidx[[i]]] <- brewer.pal(9, "Set1")[i]
}
plot(chrs, peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 80), peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10))


```

Note however that there is not much we can do to avoid the above
cases. Eventually we might want to *fuse* such features into a single feature.


### Features with many peaks per sample

Here we want to characterize features that have more than one chromatographic
peak assigned in more than 50% of samples.

```{r neg-multi50-features, message = FALSE}
## Selecting features with multiple peaks
## being present. A peak has to be present also in more than 33% of samples.
feats <- rownames(feat_summ)[feat_summ[, "multi_perc"] > 50 &
                             feat_summ[, "perc"] > 100/3]

```

```{r neg-multi50-features-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "multi_50_peak_fts/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)

for (feat in feats) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot_feature(data_neg, feat)
    dev.off()
}

```

Some of these features combine peaks from isomers for which correspondence
failed to separate them into different features while most combine signal from
presumably background ions.


### Features with different number of peaks depending on the source

In this section we identify features that have multiple peaks in one sample
group but only single peaks in other groups. For each feature we require to have
peaks in at least 50% of samples. For multi-peaks we require a feature to have
multiple peaks in at least 75% of the samples (in which a peak was detected),
and for single peaks to have less than 5% of samples with an additional peak.

```{r multi-single-define, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
srcs <- unique(data_neg$source)
srcs <- srcs[srcs != "all"]
mlts <- do.call(cbind, lapply(srcs, function(src) {
    feat_summ[, paste0(src, "_perc")] > 50 &
        feat_summ[, paste0(src, "_multi_perc")] > 75
}))
colnames(mlts) <- srcs

sngls <- do.call(cbind, lapply(srcs, function(src) {
    feat_summ[, paste0(src, "_perc")] > 50 &
        feat_summ[, paste0(src, "_multi_perc")] < 5
}))
colnames(sngls) <- srcs

sngls_mlt <- sngls[rowSums(mlts) > 0, ]
fts_sel <- rownames(sngls_mlt)[rowSums(sngls_mlt) > 0]

tab <- feat_summ[fts_sel, paste0(rep(srcs, each = 2),
                                 c("_perc", "_multi_perc"))]
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown", 
             caption = paste("Features with single peaks for some sources and",
                             "multiple peaks for others. Shown are percentages",
                             "of samples per source in which peak(s) were",
                             "found and percentage among those in which",
                             "multiple peaks were present."))

```

```{r multi-single-plot, echo = FALSE, results = "silent", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "source-dependent-multi-peaks/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)

for (feat in rownames(tab)) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot_feature(data_neg, feat)
    dev.off()
}

```

### Features close on m/z and with partially overlapping chromatographic peaks

At last we evaluate features that are overlapping on m/z and retention time with
or without extending their region. If only the feature boundaries are
considered, overlapping features will necessarily share one or more peaks with
each other. Below we identify overlapping features, but also features that are
close on retention time, m/z or both dimensions.

```{r overlapping-features, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ovlap_fts <- overlappingFeatures(data_neg)
ovlap_fts_rt <- overlappingFeatures(data_neg, expandRt = 2) # isomers?
ovlap_fts_mz <- overlappingFeatures(data_neg, ppm = 40)
ovlap_fts_rt_mz <- overlappingFeatures(data_neg, ppm = 40, expandRt = 2)

```

```{r overlapping-features-table, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
tab <- rbind(overlapping = length(ovlap_fts),
             overlapping_within_4seconds = length(ovlap_fts_rt),
             overlapping_50ppm = length(ovlap_fts_mz),
             overlapping_4seconds_100ppm = length(ovlap_fts_rt_mz))
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste("Summary of overlapping or close features.",
                             "Listed are the total number of overlapping",
                             "features, features that are within 4 seconds to",
                             "each other, features that are overlapping if the",
                             "m/z width is extended by 100 ppm and features",
                             "overlapping if both their retention time range",
                             "and m/z width is extended."))
```

While no features are directly overlapping, quite some are very close in
retention time and/or m/z dimension. The largest part of the feature groups
that are close on retention time consists of only two features. There are
however some groups that consist of more than 5 features.

```{r feature-groups-close-rt, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ft_grps <- ovlap_fts_rt[lengths(ovlap_fts_rt) > 5]

dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "overlapping_close_rt/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)

for (i in seq_along(ft_grps)) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, "feature-group-", i, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot_feature(data_neg, ft_grps[[i]])
    dev.off()
}

```


```{r feature-groups-close-ppm, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Randomly choosing among features that are less than 50 ppm apart.
set.seed(123)

fts_grps <- ovlap_fts_mz[sample(seq_along(ovlap_fts_mz), 20)]

dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "overlapping_close_mz/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)
data_qc <- filterFile(dropChromPeaks(data_neg),
                      file = which(data_neg$source == "all"))
for (i in seq_along(fts_grps)) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, "feature-group-", i, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 20, height = 16, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    fts_def <- featureDefinitions(data_neg)[fts_grps[[i]], ]
    pks <- chromPeaks(data_neg)[unlist(fts_def$peakidx), ]
    tmp <- filterMz(filterRt(data_qc, range(pks[, c("rtmin", "rtmax")])),
                    mz = range(pks[, c("mzmin", "mzmax")]))
    plot(tmp, type = "XIC", cex = 1)
    dev.off()
}

```


```{r save-data, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
save(data_neg, file = paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_neg.RData"))

```
