# VAMS vs intraveinous

Comparison of Volumetric Absorbtive Microsampling to venous blood sampling

All data files as well as supporting information files (at the moment only injection sequence) are on the biobank nas under the folder 'data/vams2018'

Note that most of the files other than the peack picking and feature identification rely on R objects that are generated in the feature idnetification script. If you haven't run that then chances are the other ones will not work.
