# Introduction
 
In this section we perform the pre-processing of the untargeted metabolomics
data of the *MitYOU* project which comprises an initial quality assessment,
chromatographic peak detection, alignment (retention time correction) and
correspondence (chromatographic peak grouping across samples).

The input files represent centroided data, with centroiding performed using the
`MSnbase` package based on the following settings: smoothing of the signal in
retention time dimension by averaging signal from 3 neighboring spectra in a
moving window approach followed by smoothing of each spectrum (along the m/z
dimension) using a Savitzky-Golay filter with a half window size of 6. The data
was subsequently centroided refining in addition the centroid's m/z value with
an intensity-weighted average of m/z values for signal within the peak with at
least 33% of the centroid's intensity.

# Positive polarity

We first focus on the data in positive polarity.

## Raw data import and initial quality assessment

Below we load all required libraries for the analysis as well as the *phenodata*
file defining the experiment's layout. Also, we set up the parallel processing,
define colors to be used for the various experimental groups throughout the
experiment and finally read the raw data.

```{r pos-libraries-data, message = FALSE}
library(xcms)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(pander)
library(pheatmap)
library(MsCoreUtils)
library(Rdisop)
library(CompMetaboTools)

## Use socket based parallel processing on Windows systems
if (.Platform$OS.type == "unix") {
    register(bpstart(MulticoreParam(ncores)))
} else {
    register(bpstart(SnowParam(ncores)))
}

pd <- read.table("data/phenodata.txt", sep = "\t", as.is = TRUE, header = TRUE)
pd_pos <- pd[pd$polarity == "POS", ]

#' Define colors for the groups.
col_source <- brewer.pal(5, name = "Set1")
names(col_source) <- c("RBC",           # red
                       "plasma",        # blue
                       "all",           # green
                       "capillary",     # purple
                       "venous")        # orange
#' Read the data
data_pos <- readMSData(paste0(MZML_PATH, "2018/", pd_pos$mzML_file),
                       pdata = as(AnnotatedDataFrame(pd_pos),
                                  "NAnnotatedDataFrame"), mode = "onDisk")
data_pos <- filterRt(data_pos, rt = c(0, rt_cut))

#' Add the time stamp from the individual files and check if they
#' match the injection index
time_stamp <- extract_time_stamp(fileNames(data_pos))
data_pos$time_stamp <- time_stamp
stopifnot(!is.unsorted(time_stamp))
```

All samples of the experiment are listed below.

```{r pos-phenodata, message = FALSE, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
validatePdata <- function(x) {
    src <- c(`1` = "plasma", `2` = "venous", `3` = "capillary", RBC = "RBC")
    fn <- strsplit(x$mzML_file, split = "_")
    for (i in 1:nrow(x)) {
        splt <- fn[[i]]
        if (splt[1] != x$batch[i])
            message("Row ", i, ": batch wrong")
        if (length(splt) == 5) {
            if (as.numeric(splt[2]) != x$sample[i])
                message("Row ", i, ": sample wrong")
            if (src[splt[3]] != x$source[i])
                message("Row ", i, ": source wrong")
            if ((splt[4] == "a" & x$replicate[i] != 1) ||
                (splt[4] == "b" & x$replicate[i] != 2))
                message("Row ", i, ": replicate wrong")
        } else {
            if (x$sample[i] != "POOL")
                message("Row ", i, ": sample wrong")
        }
    }
}
#' validatePdata(pData(data_pos))

tab <- pData(data_pos)[, -4]
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste0("Data files and samples for positive polarity"))

```

The data set consists thus of samples from in total 22 individuals, with
measurements performed on plasma, venous and capillary blood samples as well as
on red blood cells for each. Measurements were performed in two runs, with each
sample measured in duplicates within each run. A pool of all samples (all
sources and samples) was used as quality control and repeatedly measured (every
9 injections) during a measurement run. The injection order layout of one
measurement run is visualized below.

```{r pos-run-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.cap = "Layout of a measurement run."}
tmp <- pData(data_pos)[data_pos$batch == "31012018", ]
par(mar = c(2, 0, 2, 0))
plot(3, 3, pch = NA, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylim = c(0, 2),
     xlim = c(0.5, nrow(tmp) + 0.5), bty = "n")
rect(xleft = tmp$inj_idx - 0.5, xright = tmp$inj_idx + 0.5, ybottom = 0,
     ytop = 1, col = col_source[tmp$source], border = "grey")
axis(side = 1, line = 0, las = 2)
text(x = tmp$inj_idx, y = rep(0.5, nrow(tmp)), labels = tmp$sample,
     srt = 90, cex = 0.7)
legend("top", col = col_source, legend = names(col_source), horiz = TRUE,
       pch = 15)
```

Sample source type and individuals are randomly distributed along the injection
order.

Next we perform an initial quality assessment by comparing the distribution of
TIC and BPC values from the spectra between all samples.

```{r pos-calc-tic, message = FALSE}
chrs_bpc <- chromatogram(data_pos, aggregationFun = "max")
```

The base peak chromatogram for the full experiment is shown below.

```{r pos-bpc-plot, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Base peak chromatograms for all samples of the experiment (positive polarity)."}
plot(chrs_bpc, col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], "60"))
legend("topright", col = col_source, legend = names(col_source), lwd = 2)
```

The base peak chromatograms are quite different between the different sample
sources. Plasma and venous samples have considerably higher signal in the
retention time range from 170 to 200 seconds. For most other parts the BPC shows
similar signal suggesting that similar compounds are detected. Individual
capillary blood samples show a distinct BPC potentially indicating problems in
sample preparation and/or measurement.  We next cluster samples based on
pair-wise correlations of their (log2) base peak intensities.

```{r pos-bin-chr, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12, fig.cap = "Samples clustered by base peak chromatogram. Clustering bases on complete linkage hierarchical clustering of pairwise correlations of log2 base peak signals."}
#' First we have to bin the chromatograms to force them having the same
#' retention times.
chrs_bin <- MSnbase::bin(chrs_bpc)

#' Calculating the correlation on the log2 transformed bp signals
cormat <- cor(log2(do.call(cbind, lapply(chrs_bin, intensity))))
colnames(cormat) <- rownames(cormat) <- sampleNames(data_pos)
ann <- pData(data_pos)[, c("batch", "source")]
ann$batch <- factor(ann$batch, levels = c("31012018", "1022018"))
res <- pheatmap(cormat, annotation_col = ann, cutree_cols = 3,
                annotation_color = list(source = col_source))

```

The base peak chromatograms cluster mainly by the sample source, separating
mostly capillary samples and red blood cells from other sources (i.e. plasma,
all, and venous samples). One cluster of samples, consisting exclusively of
capillary and red blood cell samples, mostly from the second batch, separates
from all others samples.

The samples belonging to the first cluster of capillary and red blood samples
that separates from all other samples are listed in the table below.

```{r pos-cluster-one-sample-table, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
clust_one <- cutree(res$tree_col, 2)
clust_one_idx <- which(clust_one == 2)
tab <- pData(data_pos)[clust_one_idx, c("batch", "sample",
                                        "source", "replicate", "inj_idx")]
pandoc.table(tab[order(tab$sample), ], style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste("Samples separating from all others based on",
                             "their base peak chromatograms."))
```

As described already above, the potential outlier samples are exclusively RBC
and capillary blood samples. For individuals *12*, *16*, *17* and *19* both
replicates are affected suggesting a potential problem with the extraction or
the sample tube. All the others the actual measurement might be failed, since
the other replicate was not affected. Note that all except one measurement are
from the second batch.

In the plot below the base peak chromatogram of samples from this cluster are
highlighted.

```{r pos-cluster-one-bpc-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Base peak chromatogram with samples identified as potential outliers being highlighted in red."}
col_clust <- c("#00000020", "#ff000080")
plot(chrs_bpc, col = col_clust[clust_one])

#' cols <- rep("#00000020", length(chrs_bpc$source))
#' cols[chrs_bpc$sample %in% c("16", "19")] <- "#ff000080"
#' #'cols[c(74, 178)] <- "#ff000080"
#' plot(chrs_bpc, col = cols)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#' Perform the PCA
pc <- prcomp(t(log2(do.call(cbind, lapply(chrs_bin, intensity)))),
             scale = FALSE, center = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot_pca(pc, col = col_clust[clust_one], pc_x = 1, pc_y = 2)
plot_pca(pc, col = col_clust[clust_one], pc_x = 3, pc_y = 4)
plot_pca(pc, col = col_clust[clust_one], pc_x = 2, pc_y = 3)
text(pc$x[, 2], pc$x[, 3], label = sampleNames(chrs_bin),
     col = col_clust[clust_one])


#' cols <- rep("#00000040", length(chrs_bin$source))
#' keep_idx <- c(166, 169, 133, 192, 111, 125, 113, 157)
#' rem_idx <- c(74, 158, 172, 174, 194, 177, 149, 186, 188, 167, 178)
#' cols[keep_idx] <- "#0000ff80"
#' cols[rem_idx] <- "#ff000080"

#' BioCHRIStes::plot_pca(pc, col = cols, pc_x = 2, pc_y = 3)

#' plot(chrs_bpc, col = cols)

```

Next we evaluate the distribution of base peak and total ion values per sample
to identify potentially problematic samples/injections. In addition we calculate
per-sample RLA (relative log abundance) [@DeLivera:2012bw] values representing
average log2 signal (either base peak or total ion) of each sample relative to
the median log2 signal of all samples within the same group. The per sample RLA
values help to spot samples with an overall different average signal compared to
all other samples within the same sample group, which is in our case the sample
source.

```{r pos-bpc-boxplot, message = FALSE, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Distribution of the spectras' base peak signal per sample (top) and average RLA of base peak signals per sample (bottom). Potential outlier samples identified based on their base peak intensities are indicated with squares."}
bpcs <- lapply(chrs_bpc, intensity)
xl <- c(1, length(bpcs))
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 0, 0.1))
boxplot(lapply(bpcs, log2), col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], 60),
        pch = NA, xaxt = "n", ylab = expression(log[2]~base~peak~intensity),
        xlim = xl)
grid(nx = NULL)
par(mar = c(3, 4.3, 0.5, 0.1))
bpcs_rla <- rla(vapply(bpcs, mean, numeric(1)), group = chrs_bpc$source)
pch <- rep(16, length(bpcs_rla))
pch[clust_one_idx] <- 15
plot(bpcs_rla, xlab = "", ylab = "average RLA", xlim = xl,
     col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], 80), pch = pch)
grid(nx = NULL)

```

Overall seen, the signal in the second batch is higher than in the first,
specifically if the QC samples from both batches are compared (green colored
boxes or points), that show an about two-fold higher overall signal in the
second batch. The distribution of base peak signals varies between samples with
stretches of measurements in both batches showing lower distribution than
samples measured before or after. Two red blood cell samples (one in the first
and one in the second) have much lower average base peak intensities, most
likely due to a failed injection (because the signal of the replicated
measurement is *normal*) and should thus be excluded from the analysis.  Only 4
of the 19 samples identified as potential outliers based on the correlation of
their base peak chromatograms deviate from other samples based on their base
peak RLA value.  Below we list all samples for which one replicate yielded a
more than two-fold difference in average base peak signal.

```{r pos-bpc-outlier, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "asis"}
outl <- abs(bpcs_rla) > 1
outl_smps <- paste0(chrs_bpc$sample[outl], chrs_bpc$source[outl])
all_outl <- paste0(chrs_bpc$sample, chrs_bpc$source) %in% outl_smps
tab <- cbind(pData(chrs_bpc)[all_outl, ], bpc_rla = bpcs_rla[all_outl])

pandoc.table(tab[order(abs(tab$bpc_rla), decreasing = TRUE), ],
             style = "rmarkdown", 
             caption = paste0("Samples for which one replicated measurement ",
                              "had a more than two-fold difference in average",
                              " base peak intensity."))
```

For all of the above samples one of the two replicates yielded a more than
two-fold difference in average base peak intensity, while the other did not. We
might thus exclude the problematic replicate for these samples. The two
capillary blood samples with a higher average intensity are most likely those
that showed also higher signal in the base peak chromatogram plot above. The
results on the total ion signal (i.e. the sum of signal per spectrum) is
comparable, but less pronounced (data not shown).

### Summary

The base peak and total ion chromatogram between samples from the various
sources are different. The distribution of signals does also show a relatively
large variation between all samples and batches, with the signal being generally
higher in the second batch. Four potentially problematic samples have been
spotted that show either more than two-fold lower or higher average base peak
intensity than other samples from the same source. These are two RBC and two
capillary blood samples. This is most likely caused by a failed/problematic
injection, because one replicate is affected.


## Chromatographic peak detection

Key parameters for the *centWave* [@Tautenhahn:2008fx] chromatographic peak
detection algorithm are `ppm` and `peakwidth`, the first defining the allowed
scattering in m/z dimension of valid chromatographic peaks and the second
defining the lower and upper bound of chromatographic peak width (in
seconds). We empirically determined the *best* values for these parameters by
evaluating the raw MS data for selected known compounds in QC samples. We load
below the most likely adduct and the expected retention time for the standards
defined in [this
repository](http://github.com/EuracBiomedicalResearch/lcms-standards).

```{r known-cmps}
library(CompoundDb)
std_info <- read.table(
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EuracBiomedicalResearch/lcms-standards/master/data/standards_dilution.txt",
    sep = "\t", header = TRUE, as.is = TRUE)
std_info <- std_info[!is.na(std_info[, grep("POS", colnames(std_info))]), ]
rownames(std_info) <- 1:nrow(std_info)
std_info$mzneut = NA
std_info$mz_ion = NA
for (i in seq(nrow(std_info))) {
    if (grepl("C", std_info$formula[i])){
        std_info$mzneut[i] <- getMolecule(
            as.character(std_info$formula[i]))$exactmass
    } else {
        std_info$mzneut[i] = as.numeric(std_info$formula[i])
    }
    #' Calculate also the m/z
    std_info$mz_ion[i] <- unlist(
        mass2mz(std_info$mzneut[i],
                adduct = as.character(
                    std_info[i, grep("POS", colnames(std_info))])))
}
```

A `ppm = 50` was determined by a previous analysis (not shown here) that based
on the respective example in the
[metabolomics2018](https://github.com/jorainer/metabolomics2018) workflow. The
setting for the `peakwidth` parameter (`peakwidth = c(2, 20)`) was based on a
similar analysis of the present, and on other data sets employing the same LC
setup.

```{r pos-centWave, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = !file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_pks.RData"))}
cwp <- CentWaveParam(ppm = 50,
                     peakwidth = c(2, 20),
                     snthresh = 10,
                     mzdiff = 0.001,
                     prefilter = c(3, 800),
                     noise = 100,
                     integrate = 2)

data_pos <- findChromPeaks(data_pos, param = cwp)
save(data_pos, file = paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_pks.RData"))
```

```{r pos-centWave-cached, echo = FALSE, eval = file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_pks.RData"))}
load(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_pks.RData"))
n_peaks_before <- nrow(chromPeaks(data_pos))
```

Next we are post-processing the identified chromatographic peaks to reduce the
amount of peak detection artifacts such as largely overlapping peaks or
artificially split peaks.

```{r pos-centWave-refine, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = !file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_refined.RData"))}
mnp <- MergeNeighboringPeaksParam(expandRt = 2.5, expandMz = 0.001,
                                  minProp = 3/4)
data_pos <- refineChromPeaks(data_pos, param = mnp)
save(data_pos, file = paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_refined.RData"))
```

```{r, eval = file.exists(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_refined.RData")), echo = FALSE}
load(paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_refined.RData"))
```

Merging neighboring peaks reduced the total number of peaks in the
data set from `r n_peaks_before` to `nrow(chromPeaks(data_pos))`.

Results from the peak merging were validated manually by inspecting 100 random
merged peaks. In most cases merging resulted in better peak integration. Most
importantly, peak merging removes any completely overlapping peaks which would
result in the correspondence analysis to artificially inflated quantified
feature abundances (if `method = "sum"` is used).

For the in total `r nrow(std_info)` standards for which retention times have
been determined (in water), `r sum(std_info$is_ok)` are considered *detected* in
the present data set after manually inspecting the detected peaks close to the
expected retention time.

          rt_width = z[, "rtmax"] - z[, "rtmin"])
})

```

The numbers of detected peaks is between 2000 and 3000 with more peaks being
found in venous and capillary samples, while fewer were found in plasma
samples. RBC samples show the highest variability in the numbers of identified
peaks with three samples yielding a very low number of peaks (between 1000 and
1400). These are from samples 11, 20 and 22 replicates 2, 1 and 2,
respectively. The m/z widths of identified peaks is on average below 10ppm. Most
of the peaks are between 3 and 5 seconds wide with the retention time width
being highly comparable between samples (not shown). Interestingly, the
distribution of integrated peak signals between samples is also highly similar,
which is relatively unexpected, since some samples did show considerably lower
base peak intensity signals. In the two RBC samples that had a significantly lower
base peak intensity RLA (samples 11 and 22, replicate 2 for both)  much fewer
peaks were however detected.

The table below shows the per-sample median values summarized per source type.

```{r pos-peaks-summary-table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "asis"}
#' Calculate per sample mean of
#' - peak count
#' - m/z width
#' - rt width
#' Aggregate these per sample group.
smpl_summary <- cbind(peak_count = vapply(pk_list, nrow, numeric(1)),
                      do.call(rbind, lapply(pk_list, function(z) {
                          c(median_mz_width = median(z[, "mz_width_ppm"]),
                            median_rt_width = median(z[, "rt_width"]))
                      })))
tab <- aggregate(smpl_summary, by = list(source = data_pos$source), quantile)
rownames(tab) <- tab[, 1]
tab <- tab[, -1]
pandoc.table(t(tab), style = "rmarkdown", 
             cap = paste("Summary of peak detection results. Shown are the",
                         "per-source quantiles of the numbers of identified",
                         "peaks, of the median m/z (in ppm) and rt widths",
                         " per sample."))
```

The per-sample median m/z width of the identified peaks is on average quite
low and consistent across sample types, same as the retention time width. The
only apparent differences are for the numbers of detected peaks. Here plasma
samples show the lowest and venous samples the highest numbers.

### Summary

The settings for the centWave-based chromatographic peak detection might still
have to be slightly modified, specifically the `ppm` and the `mzdiff`
parameters.

On average about 8000 chromatographic peaks were identified per sample, with the
median m/z width of these peaks being quite small.


## Alignment

After detection, chromatographic peaks have to be aligned to adjust for any
retention time differences due to shifts or biases of the LC. We will use the
*peak groups* method, that aligns samples based on *hook* peaks that are present
in most samples. We thus first group chromatographic peaks requiring them to be
present in 80% of the samples within each group and use these as the *hook*
peaks. Most of the settings for the peak grouping can then be reused for the
correspondence analysis in the next section. Note that before alignment we
remove potentially problematic samples. We are setting `binSize = 0.01` to
avoid chromatographic peaks with highly similar m/z values (within the same
file) to be grouped into the same feature. This has been defined by evaluating
the distance in m/z between chromatographic peaks in the same file in a region
with a high peak density (see plot below).

```{r pos-mz-distance-peaks-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Position of detected chromatographic peaks within a sample. Shown are chromatographic peaks in a region with high peak density. The horizontal blue line represents the bin width if binSize = 0.02 was used."}
plotChromPeaks(filterMz(data_pos, mz = c(756, 758)), 1)
abline(h = c(757, 757.01), col = "#0000ff80")
```

To define the `bw` parameter, the other important parameter to the peak
density-based peak grouping, we evaluate the impact of different values on an
extracted ion chromatogram with several consecutive peaks. Such MS data slices
can be identified by visualizing the position of identified peaks on the 2
dimensional MS data map with the `plotChromPeaks` function. In general, the `bw`
parameter should be defined in a way that allows separation of peaks that
represent signal from different compounds.

```{r pos-bw-definition-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result on a m/z slice containing the Fructose and Mannose peaks. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks in that slice along the retention time axis (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 1.3, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
plot_grouping <- function(x, mz, rt, param, col = "#00000080",
                          peak_type = "point", lwd = 1, ...) {
    if (missing(rt))
        rt <- range(rtime(x))
    chr_tmp <- chromatogram(x, mz = mz, rt = rt)
    col_tmp <- col[chromPeaks(chr_tmp)[, "sample"]]
    plotChromPeakDensity(chr_tmp, param = pdp_tmp, peakPch = 16,
                         col = paste0(col, 60),
                         peakCol = paste0(col_tmp, 40),
                         peakBg = paste0(col_tmp, 10))
}

mzr <- std_info[std_info$name == "Glucose", "mz_ion"] + c(-0.002, 0.002)
rtr <- c(140, 180)

pdp_tmp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_pos$source, bw = 1.3)
plot_grouping(data_pos, mz = mzr, rt = rtr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = col_source[data_pos$source])
```

With a smoothing bandwidth `bw = 1.3` we are able to separate the Fructose and
Mannose peak (see plot above). However, because peak detection failed separating
peaks for the above example especially in plasma samples (data not shown) and
because in the present analysis, due to the comparison of different matrices, we
put less emphasis in the quantification of specific isomers, we relax this
criteria and accept grouping of isomers into the same feature. We use a `bw = 3`
which reduces the number of features for the later analysis (and by potentially
grouping isomers into the same feature also the specificity of the analysis).

```{r pos-bw-definition-plot-2, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result on a m/z slice containing the Fructose and Mannose peaks. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks in that slice along the retention time axis (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 3, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
mzr <- std_info[std_info$name == "Glucose", "mz_ion"] + c(-0.002, 0.002)
rtr <- c(140, 180)

pdp_tmp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_pos$source, bw = 3)
plot_grouping(data_pos, mz = mzr, rt = rtr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = col_source[data_pos$source])
```

In addition we evaluate the bandwidth setting on the peaks for 1-Methylhistidine
and 3-Methylhistidine.

rtr <- c(170, 210)

              col = col_source[data_pos$source])
```

With a `bw = 3` peaks for 1-Methylhistidine and 3-Methylhistidine are also
grouped into the same feature. At last we evaluate the grouping for peaks that
(could) correspond to betaine. We don't know which signals/peaks belong to
betaine and in addition the peaks seem to be shifted depending on the matrix. We
thus group all of them together into one feature.

```{r pos-bw-definition-plot-4, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result for Betaine. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks for 1-Methylhistidine and 3-Methylhistidine (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 2.5, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
mzr <- std_info[std_info$HMDB.code == "HMDB0000043", "mz_ion"] + c(0.002, -0.002)
rtr <- c(140, 180)
png("test.png")
plot_grouping(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = col_source[data_pos$source])
dev.off()
```

Also for Betaine we could group all peaks into the same feature. Below we
perform the peak grouping on the defined settings and subsequently the
alignment. We perform a subset alignment that is based on the alignment of the
QC samples. While the QC samples might not be representative for all matrices,
we still assume that they might still be able to estimate the retention time
shifts for study samples. For the alignment we require a *hook* peak to be
present in at least 95% of QC samples. We also increase the smoothing parameter
for the loess function (`span = 0.3`). With the default value of `span = 0.2`
alignment resulted in spectra within some files to be not ordered by retention
time anymore. Setting the parameter `extraPeaks = 50` ensured *hook* peaks not
being discarded because of the grouping of additional peaks within the same
sample to the same feature. Setting this parameter to a large value resulted in
*hook* peaks that span almost the full retention time range.

```{r pos-alignment-group, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#' Remove potentially problematic samples. These were manually defined.
bad_idx <- c(74, 178, 166, 167)

data_pos <- filterFile(data_pos, file = seq_along(data_pos$sample)[-bad_idx])

#' Define the peak grouping parameters to define the hook peaks
#' These should be peaks present in most samples
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_pos$source,
                        minFraction = 0.95,
                        minSamples = 5,
                        binSize = 0.01,
                        bw = 3)
data_pos <- groupChromPeaks(data_pos, param = pdp)

#' Next we perform the alignemnt.
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 0.95, extraPeaks = 50, span = 0.3,
                       subsetAdjust = "average",
                       subset = which(data_pos$sample == "POOL"))
data_pos <- adjustRtime(data_pos, param = pgp)
```

The results from the alignment are shown below. The base peak chromatograms are
slightly more overlapping after alignment. Also, adjustment of retention time is
smaller 5 seconds for most of the signal, which is what we would expect from
such a small experiment consisting of only two measurement runs.

```{r pos-alignment-rtime-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10, fig.cap = "Alignment result. Shown are the raw base peak chromatogram, the base peak chromatogram after alignment and the difference between the adjusted and raw retention time. Grey dots indicate hook peaks on which the alignment based."}
chr_raw <- chromatogram(data_pos, aggregationFun = "max", adjustedRtime = FALSE)
chr_adj <- chromatogram(data_pos, aggregationFun = "max")
par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 2, 0.1))
plot(chr_raw, col = paste0(col_source[chr_raw$source], 40),
     peakType = "none", main = "BPC, raw")
plot(chr_adj, col = paste0(col_source[chr_raw$source], 40),
     peakType = "none", main = "BPC, adjusted")
plotAdjustedRtime(data_pos, col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80),
                  peakGroupsPch = 1, peakGroupsCol = "#00000040")
```

At last we generate extracted ion chromatogram plots of the raw and adjusted
data for the list of known compounds. These are visually inspected to evaluate
the impact of the alignment. The plots for some representative compounds are
shown below.

```{r pos-alignment-kc-plots, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = plot_eics}
#' For each standard, reduce to the peak with the highest intensity within
#' the observed rt +/- 7 seconds.
std_info_mz_rt_obs <- matrix(
    ncol = 4, nrow = nrow(std_info),
    dimnames = list(std_info$name, c("mzmin", "mzmax", "rtmin", "rtmax")))
for (i in 1:nrow(std_info)) {
    pks <- chromPeaks(data_pos, mz = std_info$mz_ion[i], ppm = 50,
                      rt = std_info$RT_obs[i] + c(-7, 7),
                      type = "apex_within")
    if (nrow(pks)) {
        mzr <- range(pks[, c("mzmin", "mzmax")])
        rtr <- range(pks[, c("rtmin", "rtmax")], std_info$RT[i])
        std_info_mz_rt_obs[i, ] <- c(mzr, rtr + c(-2, 2))
    } else {
        std_info_mz_rt_obs[i, c("mzmin", "mzmax", "rtmin", "rtmax")] <-
            c(std_info$mz_ion[i] + c(-0.002, 0.002),
              std_info$RT_obs[i] + c(-10, 10))
    }
}

std_info_chr <- chromatogram(
    data_pos, mz = std_info_mz_rt_obs[, c("mzmin", "mzmax")],
    rt = std_info_mz_rt_obs[, c("rtmin", "rtmax")],
    aggregationFun = "max")

#' Plot the extracted ion chromatograms
dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "alignment/")
dir.create(dr, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
sample_colors <- col_source[data_pos$source]

    cmpname <- gsub("L-", "", std_info$name[i])
    cmpname <- tolower(gsub(" .*", "", cmpname))
    filename <- paste0(dr, i, "-", cmpname, "_", "POS", ".png")
    png(file = filename, width = 16, height = 8, units = "cm",
        res = 300, pointsize = 4)
    chr <- std_info_chr[i, ]
    pks <- chromPeaks(chr)
    plot(chr, col = "#00000040",
         main = paste0(std_info$name[i], ": ",
                       format(mz(chr)[1], digits = 6), "-",
                       format(mz(chr)[2], digits = 6)),
         peakCol = paste0(sample_colors[pks[, "column"]], 50),
         peakBg = paste0(sample_colors[pks[, "column"]], 10))
    abline(v = std_info$RT_obs[i])
    dev.off()
}

```

For most known compounds alignment worked nicely, see e.g. the plot for Serine
or 1- and 3-Methylhistidine below, others could not be aligned perfectly, such
as C4 Carnitine (see last image below).

### Summary

```{r, echo = FALSE}
save(data_pos, file = paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos_aligned.RData"))
```

We used the peak groups method for alignment that uses *hook* peaks expected to
be present in all samples for the alignment.

## Correspondence

Correspondence aims to group chromatographic peaks of the same ion across
samples. We re-use settings for the grouping performed already in the previous
section (i.e. the bandwidth parameter) but reduce the `minFraction` parameter to
allow definition of features that are present in fewer individuals.

```{r pos-correspondence, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#' Define settings for the correspondence and perform the analysis
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_pos$source,
                        minFraction = 1/3,
                        minSamples = 3,
                        binSize = 0.01,

            names(cnt) <- c(nms, paste0("in > ", perc, "%"))
        }
        cnt
    }))
}

pandoc.table(featureSummaryTable(feat_summ), style = "rmarkdown", 
             caption = paste("Summary of the correspondence analysis. Shown",
                             "are counts of features, counts of features with",
                             "at least one samples in which multiple peaks",
                             "are present (column multi peaks) and counts",
                             "of features with different amount of samples",
                             "having multiple peaks."))

```

Half of the features are *single peak features*, i.e. have only a single
chromatographic peak assigned per sample. The number of features present in more
than 90% of samples is low, but not unexpected, since we do have a relatively
heterogeneous group of individuals, and are also comparing different sample
sources. Note also that for the *multi peaks* most have an additional peak in
fewer than 10% of samples.

Next we evaluate the integrated signal for features in QC samples. This is
expected to be similar between QC samples. Differences can, besides batch
effects or injection order dependent effects, also be caused by differences in
the identified chromatographic peak boundaries. We thus extract below feature
intensities and subset these to QC samples.

```{r feature-vals-QC, message = FALSE}
#' We extract the integrated original signal and use the signal from the peak
#' with the larger signal for multi-peak features.
fmat <- featureValues(data_pos, value = "into", method = "maxint")

#' Subset to QC samples and remove features not present in 90% of the samples
fmat_qc <- fmat[, data_pos$source == "all"]
nsamp <- ncol(fmat_qc)
fmat_qc <- fmat_qc[apply(fmat_qc, MARGIN = 1,
                         function(z) (sum(!is.na(z)) / nsamp) >= 0.9), ]
```

Next we determine per-row differences that will be used to asses overall
similarity between replicates. In log2 scale, we calculate the maximal
difference (`M_range`) and, to avoid results being influenced by outliers,
differences between abundances after removing the lower and upper 1% of signals
(`diff_98`. These `M` values represent thus log fold change differences in
abundances.

```{r feature-vals-diff, message = FALSE}
#' Calculat maximal differences...
diff_fun <- function(z) {
    c(M_range = diff(range(z, na.rm = TRUE)),
      M_98 = unname(diff(quantile(z, probs = c(0.01, 0.99), na.rm = TRUE))),
      M_90 = unname(diff(quantile(z, probs = c(0.05, 0.95), na.rm = TRUE))))
}
QC_diffs <- t(apply(log2(fmat_qc), MARGIN = 1, FUN = diff_fun))

```

The table below lists the quantiles of these differences.

```{r feature-vals-diff-table, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
tab <- apply(QC_diffs, MARGIN = 2, quantile)
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste("Overview of the abundance differences between",
                             "QC samples. Shown are quantiles for the M_range",
                             "(log2 difference between the most extreme values",
                             "for a feature), M_98 (log2 difference after",
                             "removing the top 1% and lowest 1% of values for",
                             "a feature) and M_90 (log2 difference after",
                             "removing the top and lowest 5% of values per",
                             "feature). The analysis bases on", nrow(QC_diffs),
                             "features."))
```

The plot below shows the distribution of log2 ratios in abundances and their
dependency on average abundance.

```{r feature-vals-diff-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Distribution of log2 ratios in abundances between QC samples and their dependency on their average abundance.", fig.widht = 10, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 1))
boxplot(QC_diffs, ylab = expression(log[2]~abundance~ratio))
grid(nx = NA, ny = NULL)
plot(rowMeans(log2(fmat_qc), na.rm = TRUE), QC_diffs[, 1],
     xlab = expression(log[2]~average~abundance),
     ylab = expression(log[2]~abundance~ratio), pch = 16, col = "#00000060")
grid()
```

Next we inspect the data for features from 3 different classes, i.e. features
with single peaks, features having occasionally additional peaks and peaks with
additional peaks in more than 50% of samples. Also, we aim to identify features
that have single peaks in samples from one source, but multiple in others.


### Single peak features

These are supposedly higher quality features. We below identify these peaks and
subsequently create extracted ion chromatograms for 30 randomly chosen ones, 10
with low (signal below 10000), 10 with intermediate (10000 to 20000) and 10 with
high signal intensities (above 2000). For the selection we focus in addition on
features that are present in at least one third of samples.

```{r pos-single-peak-features, message = FALSE}
#' Selecting features with a single peak being present
#' in more than 33% of samples.
feats <- rownames(feat_summ)[feat_summ[, "multi_count"] == 0 &

    pk_col <- rep("#ff0000", nrow(chromPeaks(chr)))
    pk_col[featureDefinitions(chr)$peakidx[[1]]] <- brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]
    plotChromPeakDensity(chr, peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10), peakPch = 16,
                         peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 40), simulate = FALSE)
    dev.off()
}

```

The chromatograms for all these peaks look OK, especially for the high
intensity group (data not shown).


### Features having occasionally additional peaks

These are features that have an additional peak in less than 10% of
samples. Again we require the features to have a peak in more then 30% of
samples and select 10 random features for low, intermediate and high
intensities.

```{r pos-occasional-multi-features, message = FALSE}
#' Selecting features with occacional multiple peaks
#' being present. A peak has to be present also in more than 33% of samples.
feats <- rownames(feat_summ)[feat_summ[, "multi_count"] > 0 &
                             feat_summ[, "multi_perc"] < 10 &
                             feat_summ[, "perc"] > 100/3]
rms <- rowMeans(fmat[feats, ], na.rm = TRUE)
feats_low <- sample(feats[rms < 10000], 10)
feats_int <- sample(feats[rms > 10000 & rms < 20000], 10)
feats_high <- sample(feats[rms > 20000], 10)

```

```{r pos-occasional-multi-features-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "occasional_multi_peak_fts/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)

chrs_tmp <- featureChromatograms(data_pos, features = feats_low, expandRt = 2,
                                 include = "feature_only")
for (i in seq_along(feats_low)) {
    feat <- feats_low[i]
    fn <- paste0(dr, "low-", feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    chr <- chrs_tmp[i, ]
    pk_col <- rep("#ff0000", nrow(chromPeaks(chr)))
    pk_col[featureDefinitions(chr)$peakidx[[1]]] <- brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]
    plotChromPeakDensity(chr, peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10), peakPch = 16,
                         peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 40), simulate = FALSE)
    dev.off()
}
chrs_tmp <- featureChromatograms(data_pos, features = feats_int, expandRt = 2,
                                 include = "feature_only")
for (i in seq_along(feats_int)) {
    feat <- feats_int[i]
    fn <- paste0(dr, "int-", feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    chr <- chrs_tmp[i, ]
    pk_col <- rep("#ff0000", nrow(chromPeaks(chr)))
    pk_col[featureDefinitions(chr)$peakidx[[1]]] <- brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]
    plotChromPeakDensity(chr, peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10), peakPch = 16,
                         peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 40), simulate = FALSE)
    dev.off()
}
chrs_tmp <- featureChromatograms(data_pos, features = feats_high, expandRt = 2,
                                 include = "feature_only")
for (i in seq_along(feats_high)) {
    feat <- feats_high[i]
    fn <- paste0(dr, "high-", feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    chr <- chrs_tmp[i, ]
    pk_col <- rep("#ff0000", nrow(chromPeaks(chr)))
    pk_col[featureDefinitions(chr)$peakidx[[1]]] <- brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]
    plotChromPeakDensity(chr, peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10), peakPch = 16,
                         peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 40), simulate = FALSE)
    dev.off()
}

```

Most of the features show peaks with irregular shape in some samples, resulting
in detection of two peaks. Some of the features represent signal from potential isomers with multiple peaks, with
some of the peaks being assigned to one feature.


### Features with many peaks per sample

Here we want to characterize features that have more than one chromatographic
peak assigned in more than 50% of samples.

```{r pos-multi50-features, message = FALSE}
#' Selecting features with multiple peaks
#' being present. A peak has to be present also in more than 33% of samples.
feats <- rownames(feat_summ)[feat_summ[, "multi_perc"] > 50 &
                             feat_summ[, "perc"] > 100/3]

```

```{r pos-multi50-features-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "multi_50_peak_fts/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)

chrs_tmp <- featureChromatograms(data_pos, features = feats, expandRt = 2,
                                 include = "feature_only")
for (i in seq_along(feats)) {
    feat <- feats[i]
    fn <- paste0(dr, "", feat, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    chr <- chrs_tmp[i, ]
    pk_col <- rep("#ff0000", nrow(chromPeaks(chr)))
    pk_col[featureDefinitions(chr)$peakidx[[1]]] <- brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]
    if (nrow(featureDefinitions(chr))) {
        plotChromPeakDensity(chr, peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10), peakPch = 16,
                             peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 40), simulate = FALSE)
    } else {
        plotChromPeakDensity(chr, peakBg = paste0(pk_col, 10), peakPch = 16,
                             peakCol = paste0(pk_col, 40), simulate = TRUE,
                             param = pdp)
    }
    dev.off()
}

```

Some of these features combine peaks from isomers for which correspondence
failed to separate them into different features while most combine peaks
identified in signal from (presumably) background ions.


### Features close on m/z and with partially overlapping chromatographic peaks

At last we evaluate features that are overlapping on m/z and retention time with
or without extending their region. If only the feature boundaries are
considered, overlapping features will necessarily share one or more peaks with
each other. Below we identify overlapping features, but also features that are
close on retention time, m/z or both dimensions.

```{r overlapping-features, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ovlap_fts <- overlappingFeatures(data_pos)
ovlap_fts_rt <- overlappingFeatures(data_pos, expandRt = 2) # isomers?
ovlap_fts_mz <- overlappingFeatures(data_pos, ppm = 40)
ovlap_fts_rt_mz <- overlappingFeatures(data_pos, ppm = 40, expandRt = 2)

```

```{r overlapping-features-table, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
tab <- rbind(overlapping = length(ovlap_fts),
             overlapping_within_4seconds = length(ovlap_fts_rt),
             overlapping_50ppm = length(ovlap_fts_mz),
             overlapping_4seconds_100ppm = length(ovlap_fts_rt_mz))
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste("Summary of overlapping or close features.",
                             "Listed are the total number of overlapping",
                             "features, features that are within 4 seconds to",
                             "each other, features that are overlapping if the",
                             "m/z width is extended by 100 ppm and features",
                             "overlapping if both their retention time range",
                             "and m/z width is extended."))
```

While no features are directly overlapping, quite some are very close in
retention time and/or m/z dimension. Most of these features represent signal
from long signal

```{r feature-groups-close-ppm, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#' Randomly choosing among features that are less than 50 ppm apart.
set.seed(123)

fts_grps <- ovlap_fts_mz[sample(seq_along(ovlap_fts_mz), 20)]

dr <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "overlapping_close_mz/")
dir.create(dr, showWarnings = FALSE)
#' Use the pool data...
data_qc <- filterFile(dropChromPeaks(data_pos),
                      file = which(data_pos$source == "all"))

for (i in seq_along(fts_grps)) {
    fn <- paste0(dr, "feature-group-", i, ".png")
    png(fn, width = 20, height = 16, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    fts_def <- featureDefinitions(data_pos)[fts_grps[[i]], ]
    pks <- chromPeaks(data_pos)[unlist(fts_def$peakidx), ]
    tmp <- filterMz(filterRt(data_qc, range(pks[, c("rtmin", "rtmax")])),
                    mz = range(pks[, c("mzmin", "mzmax")]))
    plot(tmp, type = "XIC", cex = 1)
    dev.off()
}

```


```{r save-data, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
save(data_pos, file = paste0(RDATA_PATH, "data_pos.RData"))

```
