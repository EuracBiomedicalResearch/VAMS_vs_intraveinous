# Introduction

In this section we perform the pre-processing of the untargeted metabolomics
data of the *MitYOU* project which comprises an initial quality assessment,
chromatographic peak detection, alignment (retention time correction) and
correspondence (chromatographic peak grouping across samples).

The input files represent centroided data, with centroiding performed using the
`MSnbase` package based on the following settings: smoothing of the signal in
retention time dimension by averaging signal from 3 neighboring spectra in a
moving window approach followed by smoothing of each spectrum (along the m/z
dimension) using a Savitzky-Golay filter with a half window size of 6. The data
was subsequently centroided refining in addition the centroid's m/z value with
an intensity-weighted average of m/z values for signal within the peak with at
least 33% of the centroid's intensity.

# Positive polarity

We first focus on the data in positive polarity.

## Raw data import and initial quality assessment

Below we load all required libraries for the analysis as well as the *phenodata*
file defining the experiment's layout. Also, we set up the parallel processing,
define colors to be used for the various experimental groups throughout the
experiment and finally read the raw data.

```{r pos-libraries-data, message = FALSE}
library(xcms)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(pander)
library(doParallel)
library(magrittr)
registerDoParallel(ncores)
register(DoparParam(), default = TRUE)

pd <- read.table("data/phenodata.txt", sep = "\t", as.is = TRUE, header = TRUE)
pd_pos <- pd[pd$polarity == "POS", ]

## Define colors for the groups.
col_source <- brewer.pal(5, name = "Set1")
names(col_source) <- c("RBC",           # red
                       "plasma",        # blue
                       "all",           # green
                       "capillary",     # purple
                       "venous")        # orange
## Read the data
data_pos <- readMSData(paste0(MZML_PATH, sub(".mzML", "_csp1_SG6_dp33.mzML",
                                             pd_pos$mzML_file)),
                       pdata = as(AnnotatedDataFrame(pd_pos),
                                  "NAnnotatedDataFrame"), mode = "onDisk")
```

All samples of the experiment are listed below.

```{r pos-phenodata, message = FALSE, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
validatePdata <- function(x) {
    src <- c(`1` = "plasma", `2` = "venous", `3` = "capillary", RBC = "RBC")
    fn <- strsplit(x$mzML_file, split = "_")
    for (i in 1:nrow(x)) {
        splt <- fn[[i]]
        if (splt[1] != x$batch[i])
            message("Row ", i, ": batch wrong")
        if (length(splt) == 5) {
            if (as.numeric(splt[2]) != x$sample[i])
                message("Row ", i, ": sample wrong")
            if (src[splt[3]] != x$source[i])
                message("Row ", i, ": source wrong")
            if ((splt[4] == "a" & x$replicate[i] != 1) ||
                (splt[4] == "b" & x$replicate[i] != 2))
                message("Row ", i, ": replicate wrong")
        } else {
            if (x$sample[i] != "POOL")
                message("Row ", i, ": sample wrong")
        }
    }
}
## validatePdata(pData(data_pos))

tab <- pData(data_pos)[, -4]
pandoc.table(tab, style = "rmarkdown",
             caption = paste0("Data files and samples for positive polarity"))

```

The data set consists thus of samples from in total 22 individuals, with
measurements performed on plasma, venous and capillary blood samples as well as
on red blood cells for each. Measurements were performed in two runs, with each
sample measured in duplicates within each run. A pool of all samples (all
sources and samples) was used as quality control and repeatedly measured (every
9 injections) during a measurement run. The injection order layout of one
measurement run is visualized below.

```{r pos-run-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.cap = "Layout of a measurement run."}
tmp <- pData(data_pos)[data_pos$batch == 31012018, ]
par(mar = c(2, 0, 2, 0))
plot(3, 3, pch = NA, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylim = c(0, 2),
     xlim = c(0.5, nrow(tmp) + 0.5), bty = "n")
rect(xleft = tmp$inj_idx - 0.5, xright = tmp$inj_idx + 0.5, ybottom = 0,
     ytop = 1, col = col_source[tmp$source], border = "grey")
axis(side = 1, line = 0, las = 2)
text(x = tmp$inj_idx, y = rep(0.5, nrow(tmp)), labels = tmp$sample,
     srt = 90, cex = 0.7)
legend("top", col = col_source, legend = names(col_source), horiz = TRUE,
       pch = 15)
```

Sample source type and individuals are randomly distributed along the injection
order.

Next we perform an initial quality assessment by comparing the distribution of
TIC and BPC values from the spectra between all samples.

```{r pos-calc-tic, message = FALSE}
chrs_tic <- chromatogram(data_pos, aggregationFun = "sum")
chrs_bpc <- chromatogram(data_pos, aggregationFun = "max")
```

The base peak chromatogram for the full experiment is shown below.

```{r pos-bpc-plot, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Base peak chromatograms for all samples of the experiment (positive polarity)."}
plot(chrs_bpc, col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], "60"))
legend("topright", col = col_source, legend = names(col_source), lwd = 2)

```

The base peak chromatograms are quite different between the different sample
sources. Plasma and venous samples have considerably higher signal in the
retention time range from 170 to 200 seconds. For most other parts similar the
BPC shows similar signal suggesting that similar compounds are
detected. Individual capillary blood samples show a distinct BPC potentially
indicating problems in sample preparation and/or measurement.

Next we evaluate the distribution of base peak and total ion values per sample
to identify potentially problematic samples/injections. In addition we calculate
per-sample RLA (relative log abundance) [@DeLivera:2012bw] values representing
average log2 signal (either base peak or total ion) of each sample relative to
the median log2 signal of all samples within the same group. The per sample RLA
values help to spot samples with an overall different average signal compared to
all other samples within the same sample group, which is in our case the sample
source.

```{r pos-bpc-boxplot, message = FALSE, fig.path = IMAGE_PATH, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Distribution of the spectras' base peak signal per sample (top) and average RLA of base peak signals per sample (bottom)."}
bpcs <- lapply(chrs_bpc, intensity)
xl <- c(1, length(bpcs))
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 0, 0.1))
boxplot(lapply(bpcs, log2), col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], 60),
        pch = NA, xaxt = "n", ylab = expression(log[2]~base~peak~intensity),
        xlim = xl)
grid(nx = NULL)
par(mar = c(3, 4.3, 0.5, 0.1))
bpcs_rla <- rla(vapply(bpcs, mean, numeric(1)), group = chrs_bpc$source)
plot(bpcs_rla, xlab = "", ylab = "average RLA", xlim = xl,
     col = paste0(col_source[chrs_bpc$source], 80), pch = 16)
grid(nx = NULL)


```

Overall seen, the signal in the second batch is higher than in the first,
specifically if the QC samples from both batches are compared (green colored
boxes or points), that show an about two-fold higher overall signal in the
second batch. The distribution of base peak signals varies between samples with
stretches of measurements in both batches showing lower distribution than
samples measured before or after. Two red blood cell samples (one in the first
and one in the second) have much lower average base peak intensities, most
likely due to a failed injection (because the signal of the replicated
measurement is *normal*) and should thus be excluded from the analysis. Below we
list all samples for which one replicate yielded a more than two-fold difference
in average base peak signal.

```{r pos-bpc-outlier, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "asis"}
outl <- abs(bpcs_rla) > 1
outl_smps <- paste0(chrs_bpc$sample[outl], chrs_bpc$source[outl])
all_outl <- paste0(chrs_bpc$sample, chrs_bpc$source) %in% outl_smps
tab <- cbind(pData(chrs_bpc)[all_outl, ], bpc_rla = bpcs_rla[all_outl])

pandoc.table(tab[order(abs(tab$bpc_rla), decreasing = TRUE), ],
             style = "rmarkdown", 
             caption = paste0("Samples for which one replicated measurement ",
                              "had a more than two-fold difference in average",
                              " base peak intensity."))
```

For all of the above samples one of the two replicates yielded a more than
two-fold difference in average base peak intensity, while the other did not. We
might thus exclude the problematic replicate for these samples. The two
capillary blood samples with a higher average intensity are most likely those
that showed also higher signal in the base peak chromatogram plot above. The
results on the total ion signal (i.e. the sum of signal per spectrum) is
comparable, but less pronounced (data not shown).

### Summary

The base peak and total ion chromatogram between samples from the various
sources are different. The distribution of signals does also show a relatively
large variation between all samples and batches, with the signal being generally
higher in the second batch. Four potentially problematic samples have been
spotted that show either more than two-fold lower or higher average base peak
intensity than other samples from the same source. These are two RBC and two
capillary blood samples. This is most likely caused by a failed/problematic
injection, because one replicate is affected.


## Chromatographic peak detection

Key parameters for the *centWave* [@Tautenhahn:2008fx] chromatographic peak
detection algorithm are `ppm` and `peakwidth`, the first defining the allowed
scattering in m/z dimension of valid chromatographic peaks and the second
defining the lower and upper bound of chromatographic peak width (in
seconds). We empirically determine the *best* values for these parameters by
evaluating the raw MS data for selected known compounds in QC samples. We thus
load below the list of known compounds with the theoretical m/z value of the
most likely ion adduct and their expected retention time window.

```{r known-cmps}
known_cmps <- read.table("data/txt/_input_Known_Compounds.txt", sep = "\t",
                         as.is = TRUE, header = TRUE)
rownames(known_cmps) <- known_cmps$id
pos_cmps <- known_cmps[!is.na(known_cmps$mz_ion_pos), ]
pos_cmps$mz <- pos_cmps$mz_ion_pos

```

This list of compounds is further reduced by visually inspecting the MS data and
by re-defining the retention time window in the present data.

```{r known-cmps-pos, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## This code needs to be run only once. We have to go through the images anyway
## to manually select/refine regions.
qc_pos <- filterFile(data_pos, file = which(data_pos$sample == "POOL"))

dir.create(paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "/tmp"), showWarnings = FALSE)

for (i in 1:nrow(pos_cmps)) {
    fn <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, "/tmp/", pos_cmps$id[i], ".png")
    mzr <- c(pos_cmps$mz[i] - 0.01, pos_cmps$mz[i] + 0.01)
    rtr <- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(pos_cmps$rt_range[i], split = "-")))
    tmp_chr <- chromatogram(qc_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mzr)
    png(fn, width = 8, height = 6, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    plot(tmp_chr)
    dev.off()
    ## png(fn, width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    ## plot(filterMz(filterRt(qc_pos, rtr), mzr), type = "XIC")
    ## dev.off()
}
## Now happily jump into the folder to look at the data and:
## a) select known compounds to keep
## b) define their rt width

```

For known compounds, the m/z values within a (slightly extended) retention time
window containing the compound's peak are extracted from QC samples and a ppm
representing the largest difference between consecutive m/z values for the ion
are calculated (for each compound and each file). The mean and 75% quantile ppm
across files is shown below in the table listing the compounds used in this
analysis.

The average difference of m/z values between consecutive scans within
chromatographic peaks of the known compounds is surprisingly large. We use thus
a `ppm = 50` to ensure that the *regions of interest* (ROIs) in which centWave
performs the peak detection include the full, or the largest part, of the
chromatographic peak of the ions. The average width of chromatographic peaks is
about 7 seconds, thus we use a `peakwidth = c(1.5, 14)`.

```{r pos-centWave, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
cwp <- CentWaveParam(ppm = 50,
                     peakwidth = c(1.5, 14),

                     prefilter = c(4, 300),
                     noise = 100)

Next we evaluate the numbers of detected peaks, m/z and retention time widths of
the peaks and the distribution of integrated peak signals in all samples.

```{r pos-peaks-summary-plot, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Summaries of identified chromatographic peaks. Shown are the number of detected peaks, their m/z widths and their integrated signal in each measured sample.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10}
## Split the peaks per sample.

          mz_width_ppm = (z[, "mzmax"] - z[, "mzmin"]) * 1e6 / z[, "mz"],
          rt_width = z[, "rtmax"] - z[, "rtmin"])
})

par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 1.5, 0.1))
barplot(unlist(lapply(pk_list, nrow)),
        col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80),

grid()

       legend = names(col_source))
par(mar = c(0, 4.3, 0, 0.1))
boxplot(lapply(pk_list, function(z) z[, "mz_width_ppm"]), outline = FALSE,
        ylab = "m/z width [ppm]", varwidth = TRUE, xaxt = "n",
        col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80))
## boxplot(lapply(pk_list, function(z) z[, "rt_width"]), outline = FALSE,
##         ylab = "rt width", varwidth = TRUE, xaxt = "n",
##         col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80))
boxplot(lapply(pk_list, function(z) log2(z[, "into"])), outline = FALSE,
        ylab = expression(log[2]~intensity), varwidth = TRUE, xaxt = "n",
        col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80))

```

The numbers of detected peaks is between 6000 and 9000 with more peaks being
found in venous and capillary samples, while fewer were found in plasma
samples. RBC samples show the highest variability in the numbers of identified
peaks with three samples yielding a very low number of peaks (between 2000 and
4000). These are from samples 11, 20 and 22 replicates 2, 1 and 2,
respectively. The m/z widths of identified peaks is on average below 10ppm. Most
of the peaks are between 3 and 5 seconds wide with the retention time width
being highly comparable between samples (not shown). Interestingly, the
distribution of integrated peak signals between samples is also highly similar,
which is relatively unexpected, since some samples did show considerably lower
base peak intensity signals. In the two RBC samples that had a significantly lower
base peak intensity RLA (samples 11 and 22, replicate 2 for both)  much fewer
peaks were however detected.

The table below shows the per-sample median values
summarized per source type.

```{r pos-peaks-summary-table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "asis"}
## Calculate per sample mean of
## - peak count
## - m/z width
## - rt width
## Aggregate these per sample group.
smpl_summary <- cbind(peak_count = vapply(pk_list, nrow, numeric(1)),
                      do.call(rbind, lapply(pk_list, function(z) {
                          c(median_mz_width = median(z[, "mz_width_ppm"]),
                            median_rt_width = median(z[, "rt_width"]))
                      })))
tab <- aggregate(smpl_summary, by = list(source = data_pos$source), quantile)
rownames(tab) <- tab[, 1]
tab <- tab[, -1]
pandoc.table(t(tab), style = "rmarkdown", 
             cap = paste("Summary of peak detection results. Shown are the",
                         "per-source quantiles of the numbers of identified",
                         "peaks, of the median m/z and rt widths per sample."))
```

The per-sample median m/z width of the identified peaks is on average quite
low and consistent across sample types, same as the retention time width. The
only apparent differences are for the numbers of detected peaks. Here plasma
samples show the lowest and venous samples the highest numbers.

### Summary

The settings for the centWave-based chromatographic peak detection might still
have to be slightly modified, specifically the `ppm` and the `mzdiff`
parameters.

On average about 8000 chromatographic peaks were identified per sample, with the
median m/z width of these peaks being quite small.


## Alignment

After detection, chromatographic peaks have to be aligned to adjust for any
retention time differences due to shifts or biases of the LC. We will use the
*peak groups* method, that aligns samples based on *hook* peaks that are present
in most samples. We thus first group chromatographic peaks requiring them to be
present in 80% of the samples within each group and use these as the *hook*
peaks. Most of the settings for the peak grouping can then be reused for the
correspondence analysis in the next section. Note that before alignment we
remove potentially problematic samples. We are setting `binSize = 0.025` to
avoid chromatographic peaks with highly similar m/z values (within the same
file) to be grouped into the same feature. This has been defined by evaluating
the distance in m/z between chromatographic peaks in the same file in a region
with a high peak density (see plot below).

```{r pos-mz-distance-peaks-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Position of detected chromatographic peaks within a sample. Shown are chromatographic peaks in a region with high peak density. The horizontal blue line represents the bin width if binSize = 0.025 was used."}
plotChromPeaks(filterMz(data_pos, mz = c(756, 758)), 1)
abline(h = c(757, 757.025), col = "#0000ff80")

```

To define the `bw` parameter, the other important parameter to the peak
density-based peak grouping, we evaluate the impact of different values on an
extracted ion chromatogram with several consecutive peaks. Such MS data slices
can be identified by visualizing the position of identified peaks on the 2
dimensional MS data map with the `plotChromPeaks` function. The `bw` parameter
should be defined in a way that allows separation of these peaks.

```{r pos-bw-definition-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result on a m/z slice. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks in that slice along the retention time axis (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 1.5, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}

plot_grouping <- function(x, mz, rt, param, col = "#00000080") {
    if (missing(rt))
        rt <- range(rtime(data_pos))
    chrs <- chromatogram(data_pos, mz = mz, rt = rt)
    par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 2, 0.1))
    plot(chrs, col = col, xaxt = "n")
    highlightChromPeaks(x, mz = mz, rt = rt, type = "point", col = col)
    par(mar = c(2, 4.3, 0.1, 0.1))
    plotChromPeakDensity(x, mz = mz, rt = rt, col = col, param = param)    
}

mzr <- c(202.18, 202.2)
rtr <- c(30, 150)
pdp_tmp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_pos$source, bw = 1.5)
plot_grouping(data_pos, mz = mzr, rt = rtr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], "80"))
```

While there might be a lot of background noise in this selected MS data slice,
there seem to be several peaks at discrete retention times that are seem to be
grouped correctly based on the selected bandwidth (i.e. `bw = 1.5`).

In addition we evaluate the bandwidth setting on the peaks for 1-Methylhistidine
and 3-Methylhistidine.

```{r pos-bw-definition-plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simulated peak grouing result for Methylhistidine. The upper panel shows the chromatogram for the MS data slice, the lower the position of the chromatographic peaks for 1-Methylhistidine and 3-Methylhistidine (y-axis lists samples). The black line shows the density distribution for a bw = 1.5, the grey rectangles indicate the peaks that are grouped to a feature.", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}


## mzr <- pos_cmps["kc_31", "mz"] + c(0.01, -0.01)
## rtr <- as.numeric(pos_cmps["kc_31", c("rt_min", "rt_max")])
## rtr[1] <- rtr[1] - 2
## rtr[2] <- rtr[2] + 2
## plot_grouping(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, param = pdp_tmp,
##               col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80))

mzr <- pos_cmps["kc_67", "mz"] + c(0.01, -0.01)
rtr <- as.numeric(pos_cmps["kc_67", c("rt_min", "rt_max")])
rtr[1] <- rtr[1] - 2
rtr[2] <- rtr[2] + 2
plot_grouping(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, param = pdp_tmp,
              col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80))

## mzr <- pos_cmps["kc_81", "mz"] + c(0.01, -0.01)
## rtr <- as.numeric(pos_cmps["kc_81", c("rt_min", "rt_max")])
## rtr[1] <- rtr[1] - 2
## rtr[2] <- rtr[2] + 2
## plot_grouping(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, param = pdp_tmp,
##               col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80))

```

With a `bw = 1.5` it is thus possible to separate the peaks for
1-Methylhistidine and 3-Methylhistidine. Note that this setting also separated
the peaks for Leucine and Isoleucine, as well as for Fructose and Mannose (data
not shown). Below we perform the peak grouping on the defined settings and
subsequently the alignment. For the alignment we require a *hook* peak to be
present in at least 90% of samples. We also increase the smoothing parameter for
the loess function (`span = 0.3`). With the default value of `span = 0.2`
alignment resulted in spectra within some files to be not ordered by retention
time anymore. Setting the parameter `extraPeaks = 50` ensured *hook* peaks not
being discarded because of the grouping of additional peaks within the same
sample to the same feature. Setting this parameter to a large value resulted in
*hook* peaks that span almost the full retention time range.

```{r pos-alignment-group, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Remove potentially problematic samples.
bad_idx <- c(74, 178)
data_pos <- filterFile(data_pos, file = seq_along(data_pos$sample)[-bad_idx])

## Define the peak grouping parameters to define the hook peaks
## These should be peaks present in most samples
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_pos$source,
                        minFraction = 0.8,
                        minSamples = 5,
                        binSize = 0.025,
                        bw = 1.5)
data_pos <- groupChromPeaks(data_pos, param = pdp)

## Next we perform the alignemnt.
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 0.9, extraPeaks = 50, span = 0.3)
data_pos <- adjustRtime(data_pos, param = pgp)

```

The results from the alignment are shown below. The base peak chromatograms are
slightly more overlapping after alignment. Also, adjustment of retention time is
smaller 5 seconds for most of the signal, which is what we would expect from
such a small experiment consisting of only two measurement runs.

```{r pos-alignment-rtime-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10, fig.cap = "Alignment result. Shown are the raw base peak chromatogram, the base peak chromatogram after alignment and the difference between the adjusted and raw retention time. Grey dots indicate hook peaks on which the alignment based."}

chr_raw <- chromatogram(data_pos, aggregationFun = "max", adjustedRtime = FALSE)
chr_adj <- chromatogram(data_pos, aggregationFun = "max")
par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 2, 0.1))
plot(chr_raw, col = paste0(col_source[chr_raw$source], 40), main = "BPC, raw")
plot(chr_adj, col = paste0(col_source[chr_raw$source], 40),
     main = "BPC, adjusted")
plotAdjustedRtime(data_pos, col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 80))

```

At last we generate extracted ion chromatogram plots of the raw and adjusted
data for the list of known compounds. These are visually inspected to evaluate
the impact of the alignment. The plots for some representative compounds are
shown below.

```{r pos-alignment-kc-plots, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

data_raw <- dropAdjustedRtime(data_pos)
## Visualizing alignment results for known compounds.
for (i in 1:nrow(pos_cmps)) {
    rtr <- as.numeric(pos_cmps[i, c("rt_min", "rt_max")])
    mzr <- c(pos_cmps$mz[i] - 0.01, pos_cmps$mz[i] + 0.01)
    ## A plot.
    pks <- chromPeaks(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mzr, type = "apex_within")
    rtr <- range(pks[, c("rtmin", "rtmax")], rtr)
    rtr[1] <- rtr[1] - 2
    rtr[2] <- rtr[2] + 2
    mz_pks <- range(pks[, c("mzmin", "mzmax")])
    fn <- paste0(IMAGE_PATH, pos_cmps$id[i], "_chrom_plot_adjusted.png")
    chr_raw <- chromatogram(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mz_pks,
                            adjustedRtime = FALSE)
    chr_adj <- chromatogram(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mz_pks,
                            adjustedRtime = TRUE)
    png(fn, width = 10, height = 8, units = "cm", res = 200, pointsize = 6)
    par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 4.3, 0.5, 0))
    plot(chr_raw, col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 60), xlim = rtr)
    grid(ny = NA)
    highlightChromPeaks(data_raw, rt = rtr, mz = mz_pks,
                        border = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 60),
                        type = "point", pch = 16, whichPeaks = "apex_within")
    plot(chr_adj, col = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 60), xaxt = "n",
         xlim = rtr)
    grid(ny = NA)
    highlightChromPeaks(data_pos, rt = rtr, mz = mz_pks,
                        border = paste0(col_source[data_pos$source], 60),
                        type = "point", pch = 16, whichPeaks = "apex_within")
    dev.off()    
}


```

For most known compounds alignment worked nicely, see e.g. the plot for Serine
or 1- and 3-Methylhistidine below, others could not be aligned perfectly, such
as Taurine (see last image below).

### Summary

We used the peak groups method for alignment that uses *hook* peaks expected to
be present in all samples for the alignment. We also tried *obiwarp*, but the
results were not that good. While most of the samples could be aligned with
*obiwarp* (using settings `response = 20` and `localAlignment = TRUE`), some
samples were completely misaligned.

## Correspondence

- Categorize features: those with a single peak per sample and those with
  multiple.
- Visually inspect some of these.
- Check data for features with multiple peaks per sample.
