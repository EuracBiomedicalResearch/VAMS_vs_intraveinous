annote = {* most methods use total read counts.
* some methods alter the distribution, thus count based methods can not be applied.

* assumption of library size scaling: sequencing a sample to half the depth results approximately in half of the reads per gene.
* not always true! bias towards highly abundant genes, especially if they are also long, since these are most likely sequenced.
* reads of a gene depend on the expression of the gene, the length but also on the expression properties of the whole sample (see example in text).

* TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) estimates scale estimators on trimmed means of M-values between samples. trimming removes by default 30% of high and low (?) M-values.

my summary: reference for "library size normalization is biased". if I got it right someing like this is also implemented in DEseq.}
